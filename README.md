# RegressionPlot

This applet allows you to add points to a scatterplot via point-and-click.  It then draws the least squares regression line, and displays the regression equation as well as the correlation.

You may then download your new data as a .csv.  _**I am aware this feature may not work yet.**_

The working applet can be found here: https://timothykbook.shinyapps.io/RegressionPlot/
